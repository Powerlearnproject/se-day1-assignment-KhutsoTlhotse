# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing,building,testing,and maintaining software using a structured approach.Its importance in the technology industry is that it helps create reliable,efficient, and easy to maintain software that meets the user's need. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Software Engineering Term was Introduced in 1968-the term was first used to solve growing software problems.
2.Object-Oriented Programming in the 1980s-Programming languages like C++ improved code reuse and organization.
3.Agile Manifesto in 2001-introduced flexible and team-focused software development methods.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning-identifying objectives,feasibility,and resources.
2.Requirements Analysis-gather the user's needs by gathering and defining functional and non-functional requirements.
3.Design-plan the software structure and design specifications.
4.Implementation-write and build the source code.
5.Testing-That's when you verify the functionality,performance and security and also check for errors and fix them.
6.Deployment-Release the software for production use.
7.Maintenance -Update and fix issues after the release.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall-step by step,rigid approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Example Scenario:Suitable for projects with fixed requirements,like medical software.
Agile-is an iterative approach with continous feedback,allowing for adaptability.
Example Scenario:Ideal for software startups or apps or dyamic projects where requirements evolve frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-writes and maintain code,implements features,and fixes bugs.
A Quality Assurance Engineer-Performs tests software to identify defects(errors) and ensure quality.
Project Manager-Oversees timelines,resources,and organizes the team to meet project goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments(IDEs):it helps developers write and test code easily(e.g visual studio).
Version Control Systems(VCS):Save and track code changes(e.g Git,Github).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Bugs and Errors-use debugging tools
2.managing changing requirements-use Agile to adapt quickly.
3.Team collaboration-use tools like Git and Jira

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit Testing-tests small parts of code.
2.Integration Testing-Ensures different parts work together.
3.System Testing-tests the complete software against requirements.
4.Acceptance Testing-confirms the software meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering means writing clear and specific instructons for Artificial Intelligence to get the best results.It helps improve AI responses by ensuring clarity,relevance,and efficiency in generated responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:"Tell me about cars"
Improved Prompt:"Explain the differences between electric and gasoline-powered cars,including their environmental impact and maintenance cost"
